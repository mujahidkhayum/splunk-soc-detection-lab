# Future Improvements
- Correlate failed logons (4625) with successful logons (4624) for compromise confirmation
- Add password spray detection using distinct user count per source IP
- Add risk-based scoring (e.g., privileged accounts, external IPs, velocity)
- Build a dashboard panel: top source IPs, top targeted users, and time-series spikes
